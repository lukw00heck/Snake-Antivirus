Snake-Software
==============
A simple antivirus written in Python in which can scan files. (Antivirus still under development.)

Future Ideas
------------
- [ ] Go into directory after directory and scan files inside of them
- [ ] Quarantine infected files
- [ ] Scan memory usage for viruses that attack only when program is started
- [ ] Create a GUI interface for my software

Insperation
-----------
I have always wanted to make an antivirus, but at the time I was only fluint in Perl. After learning some Python, I found an antivirus called [Candy-Software]. I loved it, but, I felt as if I was stealing from the Programmer who made it. So, I chalenged myself to build my own antivirus from scratch but in Python.
